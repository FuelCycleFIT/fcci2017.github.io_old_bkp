# Introduction

By building complex exercices divided into basic simple exercices, we could have access to many important results. The final complex exercice aims to assess sensitivity of input variables and parameters on fuel output. Simple basic exercices helps assessing sensitivity of input variables and parameters on one unit output. Combination between complex and simple exercices allows to quantify how compensation phenomenon plays on cycle output

# Experiment's philosophy

The FCCI exercices are based on a specific experiment representing a fleet modelization. Each fleet is described by a set of interesting output metrics, input variables and parameteres and facilities model features.

The goal of the full problem is to calulate the output metrics sensitivity to the input parameter, the facility model features and/or to the different input simplifications applied to the fuel cycle simulation.

For this purpose, a set of question/problems with an increasing complexity is proposed to guide up to the final exercice representing the full cycle modelisation. First exercices consists of small set of facility combined together according to the advancement in the experiment.

Exercices could be divided into three following separated steps

####  1. Simple exercices with fixed input factors

Small numbers of facilities are simulated chosen from the full fleet simplification. Input factors and simplifications are fixed. Those exercices highlights differences or agreements between different tools at the scale of the facility.

#### 2. Full fleet exercices with fixed input factors

The full fleet is  simulated from a set of fixed input factors and simplifications. Differences or agreements between different tools at the scale of the fleet is assessed.

#### 3. Full fleet exercice with variable input factors

From the full fleet modelization, a complete sensitivity analysis is run by sampling in a specified range all the input factors and available simplifications. Impact of differences assessed during exercices set 1. and 2. is measured.

# Design of experiment

## Introduction

The design of experiment aims to fully describe an exercice, from its input factors to the ouput metrics. It also include the general application cases, that could be for instance:

- Radio-protection,
- Cost evaluation/economical study,
- Non-proliferation,
- Innovative fuel cycle evaluation.

## Cycle Description

This part shows description of the simulated fleet with all facilities, connexions between them, material flows and so on. It provides for a global view at a glance of the final exercice. This might be documented with a cycle pictures allowing a better understanding.

## Output Metrics

Description of all the differents identified output metrics relevants for the considered test according to the application case. Direct output, directly provided by the model and indirect output calculated from direct output are provided

## Cycle Input and Model simplification

Description of the all the degree of freedom of the experiences. It includes:

- Definition of the input factors (variables and parameters) and their variation range/allowed values (if applicable), example:

  - burnup [ BU<sub>min</sub>, BU<sub>max</sub>]
  - FiFo/LiFo/random/mix
  - ...

- Definition of the model simplification considered in the experience, such as:

- depletion
  - fuel fabrication
  - decay
  - *loading pattern optimisation*

This part aims to identify the different degree of freedom of the input, on
which the sentivity will *in fine* be performed
